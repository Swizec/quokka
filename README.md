# Quokka

Quokka is a tool that takes your daily 750words.com writings and
figures out how happy you are, then sends you a message every few days
saying how you're doing.

It's also the happiest animal in the world, just look at it!

# How to use

Currently still creating this, no idea how to use. Hopefully I can
release it as a service soon-ish, until then, it's a hodgepodge of
haskell code you should run on a server somewhere.
